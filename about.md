### Key Requirements for Undertaking Research in Auroville

In order to undertake any research in Auroville, please note the following key requirements:

*1. Make contact with the Research Platform via email.*

Our team can then understand your research intention and give you the appropriate orientation.

*2. Obtain a visa that enables you to legally undertake research in India*

If your research can be supported by us, we will facilitate this process (not applicable for Indian citizens).

*3. Agree to share any outcomes of your research with us for Auroville’s archives.*

### Our Process

We identify whether your research project is

1. A research project that meets an explicit research need of Auroville, AND/OR
2. A personal research project.

We will process your request accordingly.

While we encourage you to explore and engage with Auroville’s research needs, our team supports all research proposals – to the extent that they appear viable – in the spirit of experimentation and collaboration that Auroville is based on.

### Support and Services Offered

- We provide administrative support for the procurement of the correct visa needed to do research in Auroville – required by the Indian government*,

- We provide logistical support for presenting your research within the community.

*Please note that strong checks are undertaken by the Indian government to ensure that individuals do not exceed the limitations of their visa. We strongly discourage doing research on a tourist visa, as any activity that exceeds tourist visa limitations can lead to a ban from Indian territory for a minimum of 5 years.*

### Exchange

Our team aspires to increase the quality and impact of research undertaken on Auroville, as well as encourage its dissemination. We are thus also interested in institutional-level partnerships with international and Indian centres of research and innovation. We welcome the collaboration of our visiting researchers in working towards these goals, and encourage you to act as conduits to concretise our research networks!

The Auroville Research Platform team looks forward to hearing from you!
