The Auroville Research Platform supports fertile cooperation between visiting researchers and Auroville by providing a point of contact and resource centre for researchers interested in our community. We are registered as a sub-unit of the Sri Aurobindo International Institute of Educational Research (SAIIER) in Auroville.
