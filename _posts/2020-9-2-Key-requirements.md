*1. Make contact with the Research Platform via email.*

Our team can then understand your research intention and give you the appropriate orientation.

If your research can be supported by us, we will facilitate this process (not applicable for Indian citizens).

### Our Process

We identify whether your research project is

1. A research project that meets an explicit research need of Auroville, AND/OR
2. A personal research project.

We will process your request accordingly.

While we encourage you to explore and engage with Auroville’s research needs, our team supports all research proposals – to the extent that they appear viable – in the spirit of experimentation and collaboration that Auroville is based on.
