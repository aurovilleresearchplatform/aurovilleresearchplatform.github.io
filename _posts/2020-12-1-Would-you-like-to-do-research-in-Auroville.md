title: Would You Like to Do Research in Auroville?
---

Thinking of doing research in Auroville? Here is what you need to know:

Every year many researchers come to do academic research in Auroville, usually in pursuit of a PhD or other degree. We are happy to receive them as Auroville is an experiment for all of humanity. Over the years, we have noticed that some things are good to know and do before coming to Auroville. Here is a short overview of how you can approach a research project in Auroville.

# Starting out

While it is small and clearly centered around a core set of values, Auroville is a very complex place. We advise that you familiarize yourself through reading the articles on [the main Auroville website](https://www.auroville.org) and perhaps have a look at [the Auroville Adventure blog](https://adventure.auroville.com). It is also a great idea to read an introduction to Sri Aurobindo’s life and work, such as *The Adventure of Consciousness* by Satprem (you can find a free version online [here](https://www.auro-ebooks.com/sri-aurobindo-or-the-adventure-of-consciousness/)).

There is a lot that can be found online about Auroville, but please be aware that much content that is produced by non-Aurovilians is designed to draw attention, not to give accurate information.

Please also have a look at the [Auroville Repository](https://aurorepo.in), where most academic research on Auroville can be found. If you are interested in a particular topic, make sure to familiarize yourself with what has already been written about it!

For a nice bibliography of ‘must-reads’, see the list of academic works posted at the end of this article.

# Defining your project

First of all, it’s important to make an initial distinction. Do you want to do:

- A completely independent research project?

- A research project that answers to a research need of Auroville?

- A hybrid project, that answers your own research questions while also addressing questions of the Auroville community?

There are slightly different procedures for each, especially if you are not an Indian national.

**Independent research project:** The Research Platform can support an independent research project from the early stages of creating a proposal to the final ones of dissemination and reporting. Along the way, we can help you get in touch with relevant participants, offer you a desk to work from while in the field, and give input and feedback on your project. As an independent researcher, you are asked to take care of your own visa and you will be asked to pay Auroville’s guest contribution.

**A research project that responds to a research need:** Please have a look at [the Savi website](https://auroville-learning.net/what-you-can-do/research/) for an overview of Auroville’s current research needs to see which project fits you best. Get in touch with us and let us know which project attracts you. We will reach out to the host organisation and see if they can accommodate you as a research volunteer. Savi will help you secure a volunteer visa, and you will be asked to pay Auroville’s volunteer contribution.

**A hybrid project:** Please reach out to us <a href="mailto:researchplatform@auroville.org.in">researchplatform@auroville.org.in</a> and we will decide together what format makes the most sense.

We encourage everyone to do some form of part-time volunteering besides doing their research. It is not only a great way to give back to the community, but also a good opportunity to meet and exchange with Aurovilians and get a good feel for what Auroville is about!

# Coming to Auroville

Make sure to secure accommodation in Auroville well in advance, as guesthouses are often full, especially in the busy season (December to early March). Once you are here, we can have an initial meeting to see how we can support you in starting your field research.

We recommend that you plan your field research for a duration of at least 3 months, as it can take some time to get used to the environment and explore the many different facets of Auroville. For tips on doing research in the Auroville context, please have a look at our [Guide for Researchers]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Guide-for-Visiting-Researchers-in-Auroville_04_2020.pdf)!

# Finances

Wondering about the financial aspect of your field research in Auroville? Please note that the Research Platform does not fund any research, we support you in carrying it out. Do make sure that you have enough funds to take care of yourself while in the field.

Here is our best guess of your expected costs on a medium budget (all amounts are in Indian Rupees):

- Taxi from the Chennai International Airport (airport code - MAA): Rs. 2400

- Auroville Guest Account Deposit (this amount is refunded at the end of your stay): Rs. 500

- Auroville City Services Contribution: As a Guest Rs. 150 per day, as a Volunteer Rs. 900 per month.

- Transport within Auroville: Small motorcycle plus petrol ~ Rs. 2700 to Rs. 3500 per month; e-scooter Rs 285/day; Bicycle ~ Rs. 650 to Rs. 750 per month; e-bicycle ~ Rs. 60 to Rs. 145/day.

- Food: Rs. 4000 to Rs. 8000 per month according to your eating habits

- Accommodation in an Auroville Guest house: Rs. 9000 to Rs. 25,000 per month

# Sharing your research

Once you have a draft research output, we ask that you share it with us and/or your research mentor, as well as your key participants, so that we can review and send you feedback. It is especially important that you check with research participants that the information they shared with you is accurately portrayed. Please also send us your final work so that we can make it available for future researchers who might want to look at a similar topic, and the Auroville community, as we are here to learn from your observations. To make this learning possible, we encourage you to disseminate your findings in the community. We can support you with this by setting up small dissemination seminars or publishing a summary of your findings on our internal community forums.
