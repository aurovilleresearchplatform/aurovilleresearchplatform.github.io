title: What We Offer
---

The Research Platform aims to support cooperation between visiting researchers and Auroville by providing a point of contact for researchers interested in our community.

We offer various resources to ensure that your research is original, relevant and of some utility for Auroville, and that it can be executed with a strong understanding of the Auroville context.

# Our Process

We first identify whether your research project is

1. A research project that meets an [explicit research need of Auroville](https://auroville-learning.net/what-you-can-do/research/), and/or
2. A personal research project.

While we encourage you to explore and engage with Auroville’s research needs, our team supports all research proposals – to the extent that they appear viable – in the spirit of experimentation and collaboration that Auroville is based on.

Please note that if your research project meets an explicit need of Auroville you will be registered as a ‘Volunteer’ in Auroville, which has related benefits.

# Support and Services

We can provide you with:

##1. Support for your Research Project##
- Assistance in identifying collaborative research opportunities with Auroville-based organisations and projects,
- Resource-persons or experts on your subject in the Auroville context,
- Research mentors, where needed (especially for undergraduate students),
- Assistance with identifying research participants,
- Database of research done on Auroville,
- Access to a network of researchers who are currently in Auroville, or who have done research on Auroville in the past.

##2. Logistical Support for your Visit##
- We are a point of contact in Auroville to answer any questions you may have about the logistics of your stay,
- We provide administrative support for the procurement of the correct visa needed to do research in Auroville – required by the Indian government*,
- We provide logistical support for presenting your research within the community.

*Please note that strong checks are undertaken by the Indian government to ensure that individuals do not exceed the limitations of their visa. We strongly discourage doing research on a tourist visa, as any activity that exceeds tourist visa limitations can lead to a ban from Indian territory for a minimum of 5 years.*

# Opportunities for Exchange

Our team aspires to increase the quality and impact of research undertaken on Auroville, as well as encourage its dissemination. We are thus also interested in institutional-level partnerships with international and Indian centres of research and innovation. We welcome the collaboration of our visiting researchers in working towards these goals, and encourage you to act as conduits to concretise our research networks!

The Auroville Research Platform team looks forward to hearing from you!
