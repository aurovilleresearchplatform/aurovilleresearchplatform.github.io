  <h1>What is "Research" in the Context of Auroville?</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>The understanding of “Research” in Auroville is closely tied to the community’s guiding philosophy of an evolutionary, spiritualised transformation of self, society and the world – the Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. It is also informed by the community’s commitment to  transformative experimentation, which stems from its original ideals.</p>

<p>Auroville was founded by the Mother in 1968 as an experimental township in which people of all nations would strive to live in human unity and embody a spiritualised society. The Auroville Charter highlights the central role of research in realising this aspiration:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Auroville will be a site of material and spiritual researches for a living embodiment of an actual human unity.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Auroville wants to be the bridge between the past and the future. Taking advantage of all discoveries from without and from within, Auroville will boldly spring towards future realisations.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inspired by this vision, in the last 50 years the community has focussed its activity in a number of key domains – sustainability, education, collective organisation, art &amp; culture, spirituality – as part of an ongoing, experimental research into an integral transformation of life and society. The range of research practices undertaken in Auroville is diverse and certainly not always “academic”. They consist primarily of applied research (loosely defined), but also include subjective inquiries and scientific analyses. All are inspired by the potential of transformation in a given field. A few examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scientific studies on the restoration of the Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest that is indigenous to the region – one of Auroville’s largest and most celebrated environmental projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The development of sustainable building techniques, notably by the Auroville Earth Institute, the representative for Asia of the UNESCO Chair Earthen Architecture, Constructive Cultures and Sustainable Development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The integration and fostering of consciousness in educational practice, such as in the “Awareness Through the Body” programme developed in Auroville’s schools.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The emphasis on transformative experimental research in the community is not always aligned with more formal, academic research in terms of its methods, values, and outputs. While some in Auroville recognise the significance of formal research for assessing and communicating about experimentation that is happening in our community, others are sceptical of its merit. A key concern is that such research is too abstracted from life, shaped by the goal of producing a formal written output, and thereby lacking the transformational potential that Aurovilians most value. Relatedly, it is felt that academic research is unable to understand and interpret the spiritual dimension of Auroville, which largely plays out beyond the reach of traditional research methods. We encourage you, as a visiting researcher, to take into consideration the community’s “native” understanding and history of “research” and where possible, take this into account in your own work.</p>
