###	Fields/Areas of Research of the Hosting Unit

Conflict transformation, mediation, social psychology, collective governance/decision-making

### Summary of the Research Opportunity (and broader Research Project in which it is embedded, if applicable)

We are looking for someone interested to study our work in Auroville. Since 2016, anyone in the Auroville community can call for a Restorative Circle. A Restorative Circle (developed by Dominic Barter) is a community-led, dialogue-based practice that encourages all those impacted by conflict to come together to be heard, take responsibility, and empower themselves to create change.

Over the years, we have noticed that Restorative Circles – and concomitantly, the principles of Restorative Justice – are widely misunderstood or even rejected by community members. It has led us to realize that a move towards Restorative Justice principles necessitates a change in mindset from each individual on such varied topics as justice, personal accountability, the power of dialogue, collective intelligence, and vulnerability.

While we are aware of these dynamics, we would love to have a real thorough inquiry into several questions:
-	How are Circles perceived and received in the Auroville context?
-	To what extent does an understanding and affinity with the principles of Restorative Justice impact the willingness to attend Circles?
-	What impact does Circle attendance have on the individuals that are part of the process?
